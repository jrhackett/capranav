# CapraNav

CapraNav is a navigation system for the campus Worcester Polytechnic Institute.

## History

CapraNav was created for CS 3733 Software Engineering at Worcester Polytechnic Institute during B term 2015. 

## Implementation

CapraNav uses the A* algorithm to find the shortest path between locations on campus. The UI is done in Java FX. The graph is stored locally in JSON files, parsed into a HashMap using GSON. Email functionality is done using the JavaX Mail API. CapraSync (the "Get Involed" pane) parses XML data from OrgSync's public RSS feed.

## Installation

Clone our repo, open the "FinalProduct" folder. Within that there is a folder for Windows/Mac/Linux, and inside each of those is an executable. capra.exe/.jar is CapraNav, devtool.jar is the MapBuilder tool.

## Usage

On opening CapraNav for the first time, you will be prompted to try the tutorial. After that, you can reopen the tool tips by clicking the question mark in the menu bar.
